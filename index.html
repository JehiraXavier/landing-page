          <h2>Kumar Sangakkara</h2>
          <p>Sangakkara was cut from more graceful cloth, easing into strokes with the elegance often associated withthose that play with the 'other' hand. The cut and the pull came naturally to him and with growing confidence, he became a more assured front-foot player as well.</p>

          <h2>MS Dhoni</h2>
          <p>
            MS Dhoni is probably the most popular and definitely the most scrutinised cricketer from India. He has got to this point coming from the cricketing backwaters, the mining state of Jharkhand, and through a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scales the highs and lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy.

          <h2>Alastair Cook</h2>
          <p>
            Alastair Cook was never an especially elegant batter, but his determination, his longevity and the sheer number of runs he made cemented his position as one of England's greatest. As the Oval crowd in his final Test stood to give him ovation after ovation, his popularity and the respect he evoked were abundantly clear. A knighthood followed a few months later.

          <h2>Brian Lara</h2>
          <p>
            No one since Bradman built massive scores as often and as fast as Brian Lara in his pomp, and with such elegance. Even his stance was thrilling - the bat raised high in the air, the weight poised on a bent front knee, the eyes low and level. Then the guillotine would fall, sending the ball flashing to the boundary.

          <h2>Ricky Ponting</h2>
          <p>
            Ricky Ponting, the most uncompromising player of his generation, grew into Australia's most successful run-maker and sits below only Bradman among the greatest batters the country has produced.
